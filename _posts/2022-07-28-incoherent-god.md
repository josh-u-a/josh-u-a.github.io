There are a great deal of reasons that we should find the idea of a god untenable, but what is really interesting is that the behavior of theists is often a direct contradiction to their beliefs. One particular case is **prayer**. If one believes that, when they pray, god will intervene, then they must also believe that there *needs* to be an intervention. A belief that contradicts any claim that god is *perfect*. If god is perfect, then there would be no need for intervention and, as Leibniz debated, god the clockmaker would be indistinguishable from god the clock. God would be indistinguishable from nature or physics. There would be no bible filled with miraculous cases of divine intervention.
 
Another issue, that this post is really about, is the coherence of concepts. If I told you that there are these *operators* in quantum mechanics called **ladder operators**, you may believe me (depending on our relationship), but unless you have an understanding of quantum mechanics, and mathematical operators, you cannot believe in **ladder operators** because you don't know what it is to believe in. You may believe there is something called a "ladder operator" but you cannot believe in it. There are concepts that you do understand but, without sufficient evidence, cannot believe. For example, I would love there to be millions of dollars in my bank account, but my wants cannot make me believe it. There actually would have to be millions of dollars in my account (i.e. sufficient evidence) for me to believe it to be true. Lacking an understanding of a concept makes it even worse. What if I didn't even know what a "bank" was? What if I didn't know what an "account" was? Even though I cannot believe I have millions in my account with a clear understanding of these concepts, to lack this understanding would be to move in the other, more ignorant, direction.
 
Claiming to believe in god is to claim that one understands what god **is**. Generally theists just use it as an arbitrary explanation for the misguided teleological question "Why are we here?", for which they assume a belief that existence implies non-existence, and that, for some strange reason, non-existence is the default universal state and some grand power must have pulled us from it into existence. Nevermind how the grand power exists in the non-existence.  Nevermind now the grand power exists at all, and bears non of the same examination as reality. Nevermind that "non-existence existing" is a self contradiction. "God" is the answer to a question that doesn't make sense in the same way that "What is the largest number?" doesn't make sense.
 
So how does one come to have an understanding of god? Well, there are texts. These are unverified, so not reliable, but even granting that, most of the definitions are self contradictory. The common attributes are address in philosophy as God 4.0, as a focus on the 4 traits:
1. Omnipresence
2. Omnipotence
3. Omniscience
4. Omnibenevolence
 
These have been addressed thoroughly elsewhere, but I will give an example. Omnipotent beings can always do anything. If the blank in the sentence
 
"The being _______ do it."
 
is ever "can't" then the being is not omnipotent. This concept requires very little effort to exploit using the simple question:
 
"Can an omnipotent being create a rock that it cannot lift?"
 
If the answer is "yes", then there exists something it *can't* do, if the answer is "no" then there exists something it *can't* do. I may post something on these contradictions later, as there are many, and when we account for more than just one trait, more contradictions arise, but this is enough for this post.
 
There is also the matter that many theists believe we cannot comprehend god, and given the definitions available, they aren't wrong, however they cannot then claim to believe in god, as they don't understand what it is they claim to believe.
 
 
 
And a last bit, which I might make as another post, is about knowledge level. It's a small argument, so maybe this paragraph will be enough. Most people have a sense that if they learn more about something, then they become less incorrect and more correct. So if someone is afraid to challenge an idea, or belief, then they are lying to themselves about their beliefs. If they are afraid that increasing their knowledge will increase the chances that they will be wrong in their beliefs, then they care little about "getting it right" and more about "*being* right". They are insecure in their beliefs at best.
 
 
That's the end of this post. Just wanted to share about some of the places where the very actions that are enacted *because* someone is a theist is the very thing that makes them **not** a theist, but rather self delusional and highly immune to cognitive dissonance. I don't mean this pejoratively, but rather as a matter of fact.
 
Thanks,
