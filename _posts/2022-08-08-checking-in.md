Just checking in. 

The week has been average, but average for me has become a string of emergencies. I simply try to move through things smoothly and patiently, but I am often imposed upon and forced to resolve someone elses issue because they happen to be much less patient than I am, thus having to impose myself unto others (or into situations). 

From what I can tell, this behavior is largely a sensitivity to the cues of others. If someone else is volitile (or believed to be volitile), then those around the person go into high alert and over-react to sensations. That dropped silverware, an explostion, the toy that plays the song, a metal concert speaker.

That all said, the situation we are in is uncomfortable. But, later today there is hope that change will begin (if we like and get the house we are looking at).

Fingers Crossed.
