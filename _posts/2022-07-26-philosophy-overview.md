This is just an overview of my philosophies, and as such it is kind of an overview of me (at this moment).
The truth is, "I" don't think I am a "me". This is the case for many people who do any studying of
"Philosophy of the Self". Without spelling it out here, there isn't any continuity, anything constant about a person, that
we can tie to the phenomena of ourselves or those we interact with. We are, in an over-simplified definition, constantly changing matter and thoughts.
 
This has a great deal of impact in how I think. For one, I almost always think "I mean "I" as a article of language so that
I am coherent and the resulting understanding is close enough" whenever I say "I". I also think about what selflessness, in the
classically held sense of self, means for things like responsibility, and souls. What *is* an eternal soul, if there isn't anything about a person that truly defines them.
 
I also don't think that "free will" is a coherent concept. I also think that many people confuse "volition" as "free will". The ability to enact desires "at will" does not address the authorship of the desires. And to be responsible for one's wants, suggests a selection of a group of wants from a larger catalog of wants. A selection that we must conclude was the result of acting on desires. Basically, if you do something you want to, then for you to be responsible (have free will) then you must have authored the "wants", and as the rule applies to "wants", we must similarly scrutinize these sub-wants just as we scrutinized those on the surface. We must continue this for every level down. It's easy to see this as an infinite regress. So either we want an infinite levels down or our desires are imposed on us and our volition, and desire to act on our wants, is programming.
 
Another way to think of it is, either we do something because of reasons (disposition) or we don't (madness) and in either case, and any combination of the two cases, there is no space for free will. Either you "willed" it because everything led up to the thing you were doing or you went crazy which is the opposite of "willing" anything.
 
Free Will can be accurately defined as free from all coercion. So to have true free will is to be immune to interaction. To be unable to be imposed upon. You cannot respond, because if you did, then you would have to be imposed upon. What good are incentives, as your indifference would be impervious. How would you see or sense anything? How would you learn? To be truly free, as defined, one couldn't exist.
 
Another exercise that I think is useful when talking about free will is to think about thoughts. Our experience suggests that volitional actions stem from thoughts. We **think** something, then we **do** it. In this way, we feel like we are expressing our will. But for us to be responsible for our actions (assuming "us" means anything) then we **must** be the author of our thoughts that brought about the actions. This means that our **thoughts** are something that must arise volitionally -- that our thoughts are something we did -- that we must have **pre-thought** our thoughts. But that is just one domino back, and our **pre-thoughts** are themselves **thoughts** that must have also been volitional if we are to find the "us" that is responsible. We at some point have to admit that we are not pre-thinking all our pre-thoughts, and that our thoughts are simply arising out of the dark lest we try to make the claim that we have been thinking about every action we would make for all of eternity before the event.
 
So we aren't selves and we don't have free will. We are things doing only what we can, trying to do what we want, even though those "wants" were imposed upon us by physics.
 
More contravertionally, I am a determinist. There are interpretations in physics that tern to quantum-indeterminism, but they don't make sense, and I believe can be ruled out. To say that the universe makes since, until you get so-many-levels down and you conclude (via fallacy) that the universe is rolling the dice. The **assertion** of indeterminism always struck me as an outright contradiction. The very discovery of a pluralistic event, an event where the same initial conditions produces different outcomes, would undermine the **determining** of the event. Also, it's backward science: it's claiming to have ruled out all variables that could explain a phenomena rather than considering that we don't have enough information. In physics, a lot of the misunderstanding comes from an interpretation of Bell's Theorem where he concludes that "locally" there are no hidden variables and as such **all** interpretations of quantum mechanics is non-local. Somehow, it is drawn from this that there is no hidden variable, and the "locality" component of his thesis is somehow dismissed or overlooked. Prof. Valia Alloria explains this all quite well [here](https://www.iheart.com/podcast/105-daniel-and-jorge-explain-t-29862087/episode/could-quantum-mechanics-be-deterministic-90812934/).
 
I suppose it should be noted that I am also an atheist. The information I've already given is suggestive of a person who might believe in a deterministic god but, as Gottfried Leibiz once argued to Samual Clarke, either god must intervene regularly to rewind or repair the clock, which shows that god is an incompetent clockmaker, or the clock works fine all by itself, and god the clockmaker is indistinguishable from god the clock (Spinoza's god). In this case, sure, but its not the thinking creator that people try to yell into existence. For me though, god is a fundamentally incoherent idea, just as 2+2=5 is incoherent. Without the numerous contradictions of who god is, what god is, and what can be known of god that is found within religious text, we can settle on the definition that god is the creator or everything. This is the real definition that people turn to, asking teleological, and self misleading, questions like "why are we here?". But it is this definition that refutes the idea of god the most. If god is real then there must be evidence of god, and that evidence has to be of the components that make the creature god. So, there must be some evidence of god creating reality, and creating existence. However, in both cases, whether god is true or not true, the evidence would not be *in* reality, but ruining th definition of **real**. Nothing can create existence (or reality), lets we claim that **"non-existence exists"** (and "fantasy is real"), which are self-contradicting claims as surely as "there are no empirical truths" is self-contradicting.
 
 I will likely write about each of these in more detail in the future, but this should do as an overview.

 Thanks,
