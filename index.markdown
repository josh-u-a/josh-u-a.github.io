Welcome to my weird little world. Oh, it's not any weirder than yours, just a different weird.
I am also using this site as a tool for learning how to use a site. 
I will talk about a lot of things, but some of my main interests are:
- Physics
- Mathematics
- Philosophy
- Coding
- Data Science and Analysis

I hope something I put here will be found useful or enjoyable.
